## ACADEMIC PROJECTS
**Title:** Coalition-game based Genetic Algorithm to Perform Dimension Reduction of Human Activity Recognition Datasets\
**Duration:** July 2019 – Present\
**Objective:** To use coalition-game in GA to find a highly informative feature subset from HAR features\
**Individual Role:** Introduced a coalition-game and Shapley value-dependent fitness function which in turn guided the selection of important features and modified the mutation function of GA\

Title: Introduction of a Pearson Correlation Coefficient and Mutual Information Dependent Feature Ranking Technique\
Duration: July 2019 – Present\
Objective: To develop a new feature ranking technique combining the statistical interpretations of PCC and MI\
Individual Role: Proposed a new feature-ranking criterion which use feature-feature correlation (through PCC value) as well as feature-class correlation (through MI value)\

Title: Image Contrast Enhancement using Nature-inspired Optimization Algorithms and Entropy-based Fitness Values\
Duration: July 2019 – Present\
Objective: To implement nature-inspired optimization techniques like PSO, GA, ASO, etc. for finding optimal pixel intensity values using entropy-based fitness evaluation of candidate solutions\
Individual Role: Modified the fitness evaluation by introducing four separate terms namely edge count, edge intensity, entropy and dissimilarity measures\

Title: A Hybrid Swarm and Gravitation Based Feature Selection Algorithm for Handwritten Indic Script Classification Problem\
Duration: May – August 2019\
Objective: To reduce of Automatic Script Identification (ASI) datasets using an effective hybridization of PSO and GSA\
Individual Role: Developed a model which used PSO’s local searching capabilities to overcome GSA’s low exploitation ability which was applied to Indian script-based features like DHT, HOG, MLG, etc.\

Title: Embedded Chaotic Whale Survival Algorithm for Filter-Wrapper Feature Selection\
Duration: March – May 2019\
Objective: To introduce an embedded version of the popular wrapper model known as Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA)\
Individual Role: Developed ECWSA which is an embedded version of WOA\

Title: A New Multi-Objective Feature Selection Algorithm for Handwritten Numeral Classification\
Duration: January – February 2019\
Objective: To apply an updated version of HMOGA for feature selection on handwritten Devanagari numeral recognition datasets\
Individual Role: Added memory to keep track of the feature vectors which eventually get lost in HMOGA\

Title: A Wrapper-Filter Feature Selection Technique based on Ant Colony Optimization\
Duration: August – November 2018\
Objective: Modify Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) for improved feature selection (FS)\
Individual Role: Introduced a filter-based subset evaluation to reduce the computation complexity of the wrapper model known as ACO\

Title: Introducing Clustering-based Population in Binary Gravitational Search Algorithm for Feature Selection\
Duration: June – October 2018\
Objective: To solve the problem of premature convergence of GSA which affects exploration leading to performance degradation\
Individual Role: Used a clustering technique in order to make the initial population distributed over the entire feature space and to increase the inclusion of more promising features which resulted in an improved exploration\

Title: Great Deluge based Genetic Algorithm for feature selection\
Duration: May – July 2018\
Objective: To increase local search capabilities of Genetic Algorithm (GA)\
Individual Role: Replaced the mutation operation in GA with the Great Deluge Algorithm (GDA) to increase its exploitation\

Title: Binary Genetic Swarm Optimization: a Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization Hybrid for Feature Selection\
Duration: May – July 2018\
Objective: To combine the candidate solutions generated by GA and PSO in an effective way\
Individual Role: Combined the results of GA and PSO by an algorithm called Average Weighted Combination Method (AWCM) followed by further refinement through a local search technique called Sequential One-Point Flipping (SOPF) to achieve a better result\

Title: A Histogram based Fuzzy Ensemble Technique for Feature Selection\
Duration: January – February 2018\
Objective: Hybridization of GA, ACO, and PSO using the concepts on the histogram and fuzzy ensemble\
Individual Role: After GA, ACO and PSO produced their individual feature subsets, merged them depending on the histogram and weight-based analysis
